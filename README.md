---

## 🔧 Assignment Overview

**🎡 Objective**  
To develop a basic analytics module leveraging **Langflow** and **DataStax Astra DB** for analyzing engagement data from mock social media accounts.

**⏳ Submission Deadline:** January 8th  

### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used:
- **📀 DataStax Astra DB** for scalable database operations.
- **🔄 Langflow** for workflow creation and GPT integration.

---

## 📈 Task Breakdown

### 1. 🔍 Fetch Engagement Data
- Simulated dataset includes metrics like:
  - ❤️ Likes
  - 💪 Shares
  - 💬 Comments
  - Post types (e.g., 🎢 carousel, 🎥 reels, 🖼️ static images).
- Data is stored in **DataStax Astra DB**.

### 2. 🔄 Analyze Post Performance
- A Langflow workflow was created to:
  - 💡 Accept input for post types.
  - 🔎 Query the dataset in **Astra DB**.
  - 📈 Calculate average engagement metrics for each post type.

### 3. 🕵️ Provide Insights
- Integrated **GPT** within Langflow to deliver actionable insights such as:
  - "🎢 Carousel posts have 20% higher engagement than static posts."
  - "🎥 Reels generate 2x more comments compared to other formats."

## 🔢 How It Works

### 🔀 LangFlow Workflow Steps:
1. **🔀 Take Input:** Accepts post type as input.
2. **🔍 Retrieve Data:** Queries the Astra DB for engagement metrics.
3. **🔑 Extract User ID:** Extracts user-specific data from the input.
4. **🔏 Filter Data:** Filters data based on User ID.
5. **🔢 Calculate Averages:** Computes engagement averages for different post types.
6. **🧲 Input to Model:** Passes data into the model.
7. **📈 Retrieve Output:** Generates insights using GPT.

### 📊 Data Storage with Astra DB
- **Schema Design:**
  - 👤 `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.
  - 🔖 `post_type`: Type of post (reel, carousel, static image).
  - ❤️ `likes`, 💬 `comments`, 💪 `shares`: Engagement metrics.
